## Project Title
Restaurant Randomizer

## Project Description
This application is for the indecisive foodies. It will generate a random restaurant or brewery in the city/state of the user's choosing, using either the Zomato API (for restaurant) or Open Brewery API (for brewery). The user will specify which type of establishment they prefer and will have the option to also specify type of cuisine they want. If that field is left blank, the app will generate a random establishment of any genre. 

Once the user fills in the desired criteria, s/he will hit the "Submit" button and a single restaurant or brewery option will be generated below, with information such as name, description/type of food, address/phone, website, and reviews.

Additionally, underneath the generated option, a "Next" button will appear. If the user does not like the initial option given, s/he can click "Next" and generate a new option. Think Tinder for restaurants/breweries!
